						<h2>Introduction</h2>

						<p>
							This project seeks to use data visualizations to examine the lateness of NJ Transit commuter trains. I have firsthand experience with NJ Transit, having commuted on the Morristown Line into New York City nearly every weekday for about five months in 2018. According to my experience, the train I regularly took into the city, arriving some time between 8 am and 9 am, seemed to be mostly on time as I always made it to my internship on time. However, several times when I took weekend trains, I experienced heavy delays. This made me interested in finding out:
						</p>
						<p class="text-center">
							<b>How likely is it that the train arrives on time at New York Penn Station?</b>
							<br>and<br>
							<b>Is there a difference in lateness between trains scheduled to arrive on weekends versus during peak hours on weekdays?</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							This website will guide you through my approach, describing the data source and how the data was processed, and present the results, the information visualizations created and conclusions drawn. Relevant files, including the presentation slideshow and excerpts of processed data, can be found on the Files page, accessible through the navigation panel on the left.
